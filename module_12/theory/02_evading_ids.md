# Section 02: Evading IDS

## Evading IDS
Obfuscation
> In software development, obfuscation is the act of creating source or machine code that is difficult for humans or computers to understand.
> Like obfuscation in natural language, it may use needlessly roundabout expressions to compose statements.

Packet fragmentation
> IP fragmentation is an Internet Protocol (IP) process that breaks packets into smaller pieces (fragments), so that the resulting pieces can pass through a link with a smaller maximum transmission unit (MTU) than the original packet size.
> The fragments are reassembled by the receiving host.

Encryption
> In cryptography, encryption is the process of encoding information.
> This process converts the original representation of the information, known as plaintext, into an alternative form known as ciphertext.
> Ideally, only authorized parties can decipher a ciphertext back to plaintext and access the original information.
