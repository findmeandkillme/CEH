# Section 03: Evading Firewalls

## Evading Firewalls
Firewalking
> Firewalking is a technique developed by Mike Schiffman and David Goldsmith that utilizes traceroute techniques and TTL values to analyze IP packet responses in order to determine gateway ACL (Access Control List) filters and map networks.
> It is an active reconnaissance network security analysis technique that attempts to determine which layer 4 protocols a specific firewall will allow.

Branner grabbing
> Banner grabbing is a technique used to gain information about a computer system on a network and the services running on its open ports. Administrators can use this to take inventory of the systems and services on their network. However, an intruder can use banner grabbing in order to find network hosts that are running versions of applications and operating systems with known exploits.

Anonymous surfing
> Anonymous surfing allows you to wander the Internet without leaving any track of your computer's IP (Internet Protocol) address.
> This is accomplished via a proxy service.

Proxy server
> n computer networking, a proxy server is a server application that acts as an intermediary between a client requesting a resource and the server providing that resource.

Tunneling
> In computer networks, a tunneling protocol is a communication protocol which allows for the movement of data from one network to another, by exploiting encapsulation.
> It involves allowing private network communications to be sent across a public network (such as the Internet) through a process called encapsulation.
