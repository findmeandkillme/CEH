# Section 05: Web Application Security

## Web Application Security
SAST (Static application security testing)
> Static application security testing (SAST) is used to secure software by reviewing the source code of the software to identify sources of vulnerabilities.
> Although the process of statically analyzing the source code has existed as long as computers have existed, the technique spread to security in the late 90s and the first public discussion of SQL injection in 1998 when Web applications integrated new technologies like JavaScript and Flash.

DAST (Dynamic application security testing)
> A dynamic application security testing (DAST) is a non functional testing process where one can assess an application using certain techniques and the end result of such testing process covers security weaknesses and vulnerabilities present in an application.

Fuzzing
> In programming and software development, fuzzing or fuzz testing is an automated software testing technique that involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to a computer program.

Code review
> Code review (sometimes referred to as peer review) is a software quality assurance activity in which one or several people check a program mainly by viewing and reading parts of its source code, and they do so after implementation or as an interruption of implementation.

Encoding
> Character encoding is the process of assigning numbers to graphical characters, especially the written characters of human language, allowing them to be stored, transmitted, and transformed using digital computers.

Base64
> In computer programming, Base64 is a group of binary-to-text encoding schemes that represent binary data (more specifically, a sequence of 8-bit bytes) in sequences of 24 bits that can be represented by four 6-bit Base64 digits.

Application blacklisting
> In computing, a blacklist, disallowlist, blocklist, or denylist is a basic access control mechanism that allows through all elements (email addresses, users, passwords, URLs, IP addresses, domain names, file hashes, etc.), except those explicitly mentioned.

Bug bounty program
> A bug bounty program is a deal offered by many websites, organizations and software developers by which individuals can receive recognition and compensation[1][2] for reporting bugs, especially those pertaining to security exploits and vulnerabilities.
 
BeEF
> BeEF is short for The Browser Exploitation Framework.
> It is a penetration testing tool that focuses on the web browser.

WAF (Web application firewall)
> A web application firewall (WAF) is a specific form of application firewall that filters, monitors, and blocks HTTP traffic to and from a web service.
> By inspecting HTTP traffic, it can prevent attacks exploiting a web application's known vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and improper system configuration.
