# Section 03: Web Applications Hacking Methodology

## Hacking Methodology
Whois
> Large database of whois information, DNS, domain names, name servers, IPs, and tools for searching and monitoring domain names.

Footprinting
> Footprinting (also known as reconnaissance) is the technique used for gathering information about computer systems and the entities they belong to.

nmap
> Nmap is a network scanner created by Gordon Lyon.
> Nmap is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses.
> Nmap provides a number of features for probing computer networks, including host discovery and service and operating system detection.

netcat
> netcat (often abbreviated to nc) is a computer networking utility for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP.
> The command is designed to be a dependable back-end that can be used directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts. 

Web crawler
> A Web crawler, sometimes called a spider or spiderbot and often shortened to crawler, is an Internet bot that systematically browses the World Wide Web and that is typically operated by search engines for the purpose of Web indexing (web spidering).

OWASP ZAP
> The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is one of the world's most popular free security tools and is actively maintained by a dedicated international team of volunteers.

Burp suite
> Burp Suite is an integrated platform/graphical tool for performing security testing of web applications.

Dig
> Extensive web interface to dig for doing online dns lookup / nameserver query.

Gobuster
> Gobuster is a tool used to brute-force URIs including directories and files as well as DNS subdomains.

Improper input validation
> Improper input validation or unchecked user input is a type of vulnerability in computer software that may be used for security exploits.

Brute Force Attack
> In cryptography, a brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly.

Hydra
> Hydra is a parallelized login cracker which supports numerous protocols to attack.
> It is very fast and flexible, and new modules are easy to add.

Database connection
> A database connection is a facility in computer science that allows client software to talk to database server software, whether on the same machine or not.
> A connection is required to send commands and receive answers, usually in the form of a result set.

Metasploit
> Knowledge is power, especially when itâ€™s shared.
> A collaboration between the open source community and Rapid7, Metasploit helps security teams do more than just verify vulnerabilities, manage security assessments, and improve security awareness; it empowers and arms defenders to always stay one step (or two) ahead of the game.
