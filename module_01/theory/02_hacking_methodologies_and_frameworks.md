# Section 02: Hacking Methodologies and Frameworks

## CEH Hacking Methodology
The CEH hacking methodology consists of the following phases:
- Gaining access
  - Cracking passwords
  - Vulnerability exploitation
- Escalating privileges
- Maintaining access
  - Executing applications
  - Hiding files
- Covering tracks
  - Clearing logs

## Cyber Kill Chain
Cyber kill chain
> Developed by Lockheed Martin, the Cyber Kill Chain® framework is part of the Intelligence Driven Defense® model for identification and prevention of cyber intrusions activity. The model identifies what the adversaries must complete in order to achieve their objective.
> The chain:
> - Reconnaissance
>   - Harvesting email addresses, conference information, etc.
> - Weaponization
>   - Coupling exploit with backdoor into deliverable payload
> - Delivery
>   - Delivering weaponized bundle to the victim via email, web, USB, etc.
> - Exploitation
>   - Exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on victim's system
> - Installation
>   - Installing malware on the asset
> - Command and control (C2)
>   - Command channel for remote manipulation of victim
> - Action on objectives
>   - Intruders accomplish their goals

## Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)
Tactics, techniques and procedures
> Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) is an essential concept in terrorism and cyber security studies.
> The role of TTPs in terrorism analysis is to identify individual patterns of behavior of a particular terrorist activity, or a particular terrorist organisation, and to examine and categorize more general tactics and weapons used by a particular terrorist activity, or a particular terrorist organisation.

## Indicators of Compromise
Indicator of compromise
> Indicator of compromise (IoC) in computer forensics is an artifact observed on a network or in an operating system that, with high confidence, indicates a computer intrusion.
> 
> Typical IoCs are virus signatures and IP addresses, MD5 hashes of malware files, or URLs or domain names of botnet command and control servers. After IoCs have been identified via a process of incident response and computer forensics, they can be used for early detection of future attack attempts using intrusion detection systems and antivirus software.

## MITRE ATT&CK Framework
MITRE ATT&CK
> MITRE ATT&CK® is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.
> The ATT&CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community.

## Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis
The diamond model of intrusion analysis is a model used by information security professionals to authenticate and track cyber threats.
