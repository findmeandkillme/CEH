# Section 04: Information Security Controls

## Information Assurance
Information assurance
> Information assurance (IA) is the practice of assuring information and managing risks related to the use, processing, storage, and transmission of information.
> Information assurance includes protection of the integrity, availability, authenticity, non-repudiation and confidentiality of user data.

## Defense-in-depth
Defense-in-depth
> Defense in depth is a concept used in information security in which multiple layers of security controls (defense) are placed throughout an information technology (IT) system.
> Its intent is to provide redundancy in the event a security control fails or a vulnerability is exploited that can cover aspects of personnel, procedural, technical and physical security for the duration of the system's life cycle.

## Risk
Information security risk
> The risk to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation due to the potential for unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information and/or information systems.

Risk matrix
> A risk matrix is a matrix that is used during risk assessment to define the level of risk by considering the category of probability or likelihood against the category of consequence severity.

Risk management
> Risk management is the identification, evaluation, and prioritization of risks (defined in ISO 31000 as the effect of uncertainty on objectives) followed by coordinated and economical application of resources to minimize, monitor, and control the probability or impact of unfortunate events or to maximize the realization of opportunities.

Risk management - identification
> After establishing the context, the next step in the process of managing risk is to identify potential risks.
> Risks are about events that, when triggered, cause problems or benefits.
> Hence, risk identification can start with the source of problems and those of competitors (benefit), or with the problem's consequences.

Risk management - assessment
> Once risks have been identified, they must then be assessed as to their potential severity of impact (generally a negative impact, such as damage or loss) and to the probability of occurrence.
> These quantities can be either simple to measure, in the case of the value of a lost building, or impossible to know for sure in the case of an unlikely event, the probability of occurrence of which is unknown.

Risk management - treatment
> Once risks have been identified and assessed, all techniques to manage the risk fall into one or more of these four major categories:
> - Avoidance (eliminate, withdraw from or not become involved)
> - Reduction (optimize – mitigate)
> - Sharing (transfer – outsource or insure)
> - Retention (accept and budget)

## Cyber Threat Intelligence
Cyber threat intelligence
> Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is knowledge, skills and experience-based information concerning the occurrence and assessment of both cyber and physical threats and threat actors that is intended to help mitigate potential attacks and harmful events occurring in cyberspace.

Cyber threat intelligence - tactical
> Technical intelligence (including Indicators of Compromise such as IP addresses, file names, or hashes) which can be used to assist in the identification of threat actors.

Cyber threat intelligence - operational
> Operational: details of the motivation or capabilities of threat actors, including their tools, techniques and procedures.

Cyber threat intelligence - strategic
> Strategic: intelligence about the overarching risks associated with cyber threats which can be used to drive high-level organizational strategy.

## Threat Modelling
Threat modelling
> Threat modeling is a process by which potential threats, such as structural vulnerabilities or the absence of appropriate safeguards, can be identified and enumerated, and countermeasures prioritized.

## Incident Management
Incident management
> An incident is an event that could lead to loss of, or disruption to, an organization's operations, services or functions.
> Incident management (IcM) is a term describing the activities of an organization to identify, analyze, and correct hazards to prevent a future re-occurrence.

Incident response team
> An incident response team (IRT) or emergency response team (ERT) is a group of people who prepare for and respond to an emergency, such as a natural disaster or an interruption of business operations.
> Incident response teams are common in public service organizations as well as in other organizations, either military or specialty.
> This team is generally composed of specific members designated before an incident occurs, although under certain circumstances the team may be an ad hoc group of willing volunteers.

## AI and ML
Artificial intelligence
> Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by animals and humans.
> AI research has been defined as the field of study of intelligent agents, which refers to any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals.

Machine learning
> Machine learning (ML) is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building methods that 'learn', that is, methods that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks.
