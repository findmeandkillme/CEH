White hat hacker
> White hats are hackers who work to keep data safe from other hackers by finding system vulnerabilities that can be mitigated.

Black hat hacker
> Black hats or crackers are hackers with malicious intentions.
> They often steal, exploit, and sell data, and are usually motivated by personal gain.

Grey hat
> A grey hat is a computer hacker or computer security expert who may sometimes violate laws or typical ethical standards, but does not have the malicious intent typical of a black hat hacker.

Script kiddie
> A script kiddie, kiddie, or skid is a relatively unskilled individual who uses scripts or programs, such as a web shell, developed by others.

Hacktivist
> In Internet activism, hacktivism, or hactivism (a portmanteau of hack and activism), is the use of computer-based techniques such as hacking as a form of civil disobedience to promote a political agenda or social change.

Insider

Organized crime
> Organized crime (or organised crime) is a category of transnational, national, or local groupings of highly centralized enterprises run by criminals to engage in illegal activity, most commonly for profit. While organized crime is generally thought of as a form of illegal business, some criminal organizations, such as terrorist groups, rebel forces, and separatists, are politically motivated.
