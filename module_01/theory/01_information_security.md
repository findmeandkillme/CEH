## CIA Triad
CIA triad
> Information security's primary focus is the balanced protection of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data (also known as the CIA triad) while maintaining a focus on efficient policy implementation, all without hampering organization productivity.

Confidentiality
> Confidentiality involves a set of rules or a promise usually executed through confidentiality agreements that limits access or places restrictions on certain types of information.

Integrity
> In IT security, integrity means maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire lifecycle.

Availability
> For any information system to serve its purpose, the information must be available when it is needed.
> This means the computing systems used to store and process the information, the security controls used to protect it, and the communication channels used to access it must be functioning correctly.

Non-repudiation
> In law, non-repudiation implies one's intention to fulfill their obligations to a contract.
> It also implies that one party of a transaction cannot deny having received a transaction, nor can the other party deny having sent a transaction.
