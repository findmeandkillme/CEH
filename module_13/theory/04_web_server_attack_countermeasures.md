# Section 04: Web Server Attack Countermeasures

## Countermeasures
DMZ (Demilitarized zone)
> In computer security, a DMZ or demilitarized zone (sometimes referred to as a perimeter network or screened subnet) is a physical or logical subnetwork that contains and exposes an organization's external-facing services to an untrusted, usually larger, network such as the Internet.

Network segmentation
> A network segment is a portion of a computer network.
> The nature and extent of a segment depends on the nature of the network and the device or devices used to interconnect end stations.

Hotfix
> A hotfix or quick-fix engineering update (QFE update) is a single, cumulative package that includes information (often in the form of one or more files) that is used to address a problem in a software product (i.e., a software bug).
> Typically, hotfixes are made to address a specific customer situation.

Countermeasures
- Scan for vulnerabilities.
- Apply latest patches and updates.
- Change default configurations.
- Set up proper alerting.
- Set up disaster recovery plan.
