# Section 01: Web Server Concepts

## Web Server Concepts
Web server
> A web server is computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests via HTTP (the network protocol created to distribute web content) or its secure variant HTTPS.
> A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by making a request for a web page or other resource using HTTP, and the server responds with the content of that resource or an error message.

HTTP (Hypertext transer protocol)
> The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol in the Internet protocol suite model for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.
> HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.

Virtual hosting
> Virtual hosting is a method for hosting multiple domain names (with separate handling of each name) on a single server (or pool of servers).
> This allows one server to share its resources, such as memory and processor cycles, without requiring all services provided to use the same host name.

LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL PHP) stack
> LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python) is an acronym denoting one of the most common software stacks for many of the web's most popular applications.
> However, LAMP now refers to a generic software stack model and its components are largely interchangeable.

IIS (Internet information services)
> Internet Information Services (IIS, formerly Internet Information Server) is an extensible web server software created by Microsoft for use with the Windows NT family.

Website defacement
> Website defacement is an attack on a website that changes the visual appearance of a website or a web page.
> These are typically the work of defacers, who break into a web server and replace the hosted website with one of their own.
