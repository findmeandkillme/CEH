# Section 02: DDoS Attack Techniques

## Attack Techniques
Flood attack
> Flood attacks are also known as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
> In a flood attack, attackers send a very high volume of traffic to a system so that it cannot examine and allow permitted network traffic.

Amplification attack
> An Amplification Attack is any attack where an attacker is able to use an amplification factor to multiply its power.

Protocol attack
> Protocol attacks look to exhaust resources of a server or those of its networking systems like firewalls, routing engines, or load-balancers.

Application layer attack
> An attacker may target the application itself by using a layer 7 or application layer attack.
> In these attacks, similar to SYN flood infrastructure attacks, the attacker attempts to overload specific functions of an application to make the application unavailable or unresponsive to legitimate users.

Syn flood attack
> A SYN flood is a form of denial-of-service attack in which an attacker rapidly initiates a connection to a server without finalizing the connection.
> The server has to spend resources waiting for half-opened connections, which can consume enough resources to make the system unresponsive to legitimate traffic.
