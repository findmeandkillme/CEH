# Section 03: DDoS Attack Countermeasures

## Countermeasures
- Baselining the activity on the network.
- Shut down services.
- Ingress or egress filtering.

Rate limiting
> In computer networks, rate limiting is used to control the rate of requests sent or received by a network interface controller.
> It can be used to prevent DoS attacks and limit web scraping.

Load balancing
> In computing, load balancing is the process of distributing a set of tasks over a set of resources (computing units), with the aim of making their overall processing more efficient.

Bandwith throttling
> Bandwidth throttling consists in the intentional limitation of the communication speed (bytes or kilobytes per second) of the ingoing (received) data and/or in the limitation of the speed of outgoing (sent) data in a network node or in a network device.
