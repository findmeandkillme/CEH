# Section 06: Network Footprinting

## Traceroute
Traceroute
> In computing, traceroute and tracert are computer network diagnostic commands for displaying possible routes (paths) and measuring transit delays of packets across an Internet Protocol (IP) network. The history of the route is recorded as the round-trip times of the packets received from each successive host (remote node) in the route (path); the sum of the mean times in each hop is a measure of the total time spent to establish the connection.

:warning: Add example `traceroute` command output here :warning:

Tcptraceroute
> Tcptraceroute performs the same task as traceroute, but it uses the TCP protocol instead of ICMP for tracing the route to the destination.
