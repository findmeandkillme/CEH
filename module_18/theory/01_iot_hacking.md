# Section 01: IoT Hacking

## IoT Hacking
IoT (Internet of things)
> The Internet of things (IoT) describes physical objects (or groups of such objects) with sensors, processing ability, software, and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks.

Operational technology
> Operational technology (OT) is hardware and software that detects or causes a change, through the direct monitoring and/or control of industrial equipment, assets, processes and events.

HVAC (Heating, ventilation and air conditioning)
> Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) is the use of various technologies to control the temperature, humidity, and purity of the air in an enclosed space.
> Its goal is to provide thermal comfort and acceptable indoor air quality.

OWASP Internet of things
> The OWASP Internet of Things Project is designed to help manufacturers, developers, and consumers better understand the security issues associated with the Internet of Things, and to enable users in any context to make better security decisions when building, deploying, or assessing IoT technologies.

BlueBorne
> BlueBorne is a type of security vulnerability with Bluetooth implementations in Android, iOS, Linux and Windows.
> It affects many electronic devices such as laptops, smart cars, smartphones and wearable gadgets.

Retinal scanner
> A retinal scan is a biometric technique that uses unique patterns on a person's retina blood vessels.
> It is not to be confused with other ocular-based technologies: iris recognition, commonly called an "iris scan", and eye vein verification that uses scleral veins.
