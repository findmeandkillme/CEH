# Section 02: OT Hacking

## OT Hacking
Operational technology
> Operational technology (OT) is hardware and software that detects or causes a change, through the direct monitoring and/or control of industrial equipment, assets, processes and events.

ICS (Industrial control system)
> An industrial control system (ICS) is an electronic control system and associated instrumentation used for industrial process control.
> Control systems can range in size from a few modular panel-mounted controllers to large interconnected and interactive distributed control systems (DCSs) with many thousands of field connections.

SCADA (Supervisory control and data acquisition)
> Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) is a control system architecture comprising computers, networked data communications and graphical user interfaces for high-level supervision of machines and processes. 

MITRE ATT&CK for ICS
> ATT&CK for ICS is a knowledge base useful for describing the actions an adversary may take while operating within an ICS network.
> The knowledge base can be used to better characterize and describe post-compromise adversary behavior.
> Please see the overview page for more information about ATT&CK for ICS.

Lateral movement
> Network Lateral Movement, or simply Lateral Movement, refers to the techniques that cyber attackers, or threat actors, use to progressively move through a network as they search for the key data and assets that are ultimately the target of their attack campaigns.

Command and control
> This term is also in common use within the computer security industry and in the context of cyberwarfare.
> Here the term refers to the influence an attacker has over a compromised computer system that they control. 

Zero trust
> The zero trust security model, also known as zero trust architecture (ZTA), zero trust network architecture or zero trust network access (ZTNA), and sometimes known as perimeterless security, describes an approach to the design and implementation of IT systems.
