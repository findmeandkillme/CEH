# Section 01: Wireless Concepts

## Concepts
Wireless
> Wireless communication (or just wireless, when the context allows) is the transfer of information between two or more points without the use of an electrical conductor, optical fiber or other continuous guided medium for the transfer.

Bandwith
> In computing, bandwidth is the maximum rate of data transfer across a given path.
> Bandwidth may be characterized as network bandwidth, data bandwidth, or digital bandwidth.

WAP (Wireless access point)
> In computer networking, a wireless access point (WAP), or more generally just access point (AP), is a networking hardware device that allows other Wi-Fi devices to connect to a wired network.
> As a standalone device, the AP may have a wired connection to a router, but, in a wireless router, it can also be an integral component of the router itself.

IEEE 802.11
> IEEE 802.11 is part of the IEEE 802 set of local area network (LAN) technical standards, and specifies the set of media access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) protocols for implementing wireless local area network (WLAN) computer communication.

SSID (Service set identifier)
> In IEEE 802.11 wireless local area networking standards (including Wi-Fi), a service set is a group of wireless network devices which share a service set identifier (SSID)â€”typically the natural language label that users see as a network name.

801.1x
> EEE 802.1X is an IEEE Standard for port-based Network Access Control (PNAC).
> It is part of the IEEE 802.1 group of networking protocols.
> It provides an authentication mechanism to devices wishing to attach to a LAN or WLAN.

RADIUS
> Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) is a networking protocol that provides centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) management for users who connect and use a network service.
