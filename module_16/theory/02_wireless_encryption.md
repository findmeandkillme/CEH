# Section 02: Wireless Encryption

## Wireless Encryption
WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)
> Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) was a security algorithm for 802.11 wireless networks.
> Introduced as part of the original IEEE 802.11 standard ratified in 1997, its intention was to provide data confidentiality comparable to that of a traditional wired network

EAP (Extensible authentication protocol)
> Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is an authentication framework frequently used in network and internet connections.

WPA (Wi-fi protected access)
> Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2), and Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3) are the three security and security certification programs developed after 2000 by the Wi-Fi Alliance to secure wireless computer networks.
> The Alliance defined these in response to serious weaknesses researchers had found in the previous system, Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP).

AES (Advanced encryption standard)
> The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), also known by its original name Rijndael (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈrɛindaːl]),[5] is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001.
