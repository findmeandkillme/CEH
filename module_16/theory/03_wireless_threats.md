# Section 03: Wireless Threats

## Wireless Threats
Wardriving
> Wardriving is the act of searching for Wi-Fi wireless networks, usually from a moving vehicle, using a laptop or smartphone.
> Software for wardriving is freely available on the internet.

Rogue access point
> A rogue access point is a wireless access point that has been installed on a secure network without explicit authorization from a local network administrator,[1] whether added by a well-meaning employee or by a malicious attacker.

MAC spoofing
> MAC spoofing is a technique for changing a factory-assigned Media Access Control (MAC) address of a network interface on a networked device.
> The MAC address that is hard-coded on a network interface controller (NIC) cannot be changed.
> However, many drivers allow the MAC address to be changed.

Eavesdropping
> Eavesdropping is the act of secretly or stealthily listening to the private conversation or communications of others without their consent in order to gather information.

Evil twin
> An evil twin is a fraudulent Wi-Fi access point that appears to be legitimate but is set up to eavesdrop on wireless communications.
> The evil twin is the wireless LAN equivalent of the phishing scam.

Masquerading
> A masquerade attack is an online attack in which the attacker masquerades as a legitimate user to gain access to a device.

Disassociation attack
> A Wi-Fi deauthentication attack is a type of denial-of-service attack that targets communication between a user and a Wi-Fi wireless access point.

KRACK (Key reinstallation attack)
> KRACK ("Key Reinstallation Attack") is a replay attack (a type of exploitable flaw) on the Wi-Fi Protected Access protocol that secures Wi-Fi connections.

Jamming
> Radio jamming is the deliberate jamming, blocking or interference with wireless communications.
> In some cases, jammers work by the transmission of radio signals that disrupt communications by decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio.
