# Section 01: Session Hijacking Concepts

## Session Hijacking
Session ID
> In computer science, a session identifier, session ID or session token is a piece of data that is used in network communications (often over HTTP) to identify a session, a series of related message exchanges.
> Session identifiers become necessary in cases where the communications infrastructure uses a stateless protocol such as HTTP.

Session hijacking
> In computer science, session hijacking, sometimes also known as cookie hijacking, is the exploitation of a valid computer session—sometimes also called a session key—to gain unauthorized access to information or services in a computer system.
> In particular, it is used to refer to the theft of a magic cookie used to authenticate a user to a remote server.

## Application Level Session Hijacking
Brute Force Attack
> In cryptography, a brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly.

XSS (Cross site scripting)
> Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability that can be found in some web applications.
> XSS attacks enable attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
 
Cross site request forgery
> Cross-site request forgery, also known as one-click attack or session riding and abbreviated as CSRF (sometimes pronounced sea-surf) or XSRF, is a type of malicious exploit of a website or web application where unauthorized commands are submitted from a user that the web application trusts.

Replay attack
> A replay attack (also known as a repeat attack or playback attack) is a form of network attack in which valid data transmission is maliciously or fraudulently repeated or delayed.

## Network Level Session Hijacking
TCP (Transmission control protocol) handshake
> In computing, a handshake is a signal between two devices or programs, used to, e.g., authenticate, coordinate.
> An example is the handshaking between a hypervisor and an application in a guest virtual machine.

IP Address spoofing
> In computer networking, IP address spoofing or IP spoofing is the creation of Internet Protocol (IP) packets with a false source IP address, for the purpose of impersonating another computing system.
