# Section 02: APT Concepts

## APT (Advanced Persistent Threats)
Advanced Persistent Threat
> An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a stealthy threat actor, typically a nation state or state-sponsored group, which gains unauthorized access to a computer network and remains undetected for an extended period.
> In recent times, the term may also refer to non-state-sponsored groups conducting large-scale targeted intrusions for specific goals.
