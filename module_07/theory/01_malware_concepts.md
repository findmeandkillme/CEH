# Section 01: Malware Concepts

## Malware
Malware
> Malware (a portmanteau for malicious software) is any software intentionally designed to cause disruption to a computer, server, client, or computer network, leak private information, gain unauthorized access to information or systems, deprive access to information, or which unknowingly interferes with the user's computer security and privacy.

Computer Virus
> A computer virus is a type of computer program that, when executed, replicates itself by modifying other computer programs and inserting its own code.

Worm
> A computer worm is a standalone malware computer program that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers.
> It often uses a computer network to spread itself, relying on security failures on the target computer to access it.

Trojan horse
> In computing, a Trojan horse is any malware that misleads users of its true intent.
> The term is derived from the Ancient Greek story of the deceptive Trojan Horse that led to the fall of the city of Troy.

Rootkit
> A rootkit is a collection of computer software, typically malicious, designed to enable access to a computer or an area of its software that is not otherwise allowed (for example, to an unauthorized user) and often masks its existence or the existence of other software.

Backdoor
> A backdoor is a typically covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer, product, embedded device (e.g. a home router), or its embodiment (e.g. part of a cryptosystem, algorithm, chipset, or even a "homunculus computer" â€”a tiny computer-within-a-computer such as that found in Intel's AMT technology).

Botnet
> A botnet is a group of Internet-connected devices, each of which runs one or more bots.
> Botnets can be used to perform Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, steal data, send spam, and allow the attacker to access the device and its connection.

Ransomware
> Ransomware is a type of malware from cryptovirology that threatens to publish the victim's personal data or permanently block access to it unless a ransom is paid.

Keylogger / Keystroke logger
> Keystroke logging, often referred to as keylogging or keyboard capturing, is the action of recording (logging) the keys struck on a keyboard,[1][2] typically covertly, so that a person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored.

Potentially unwanted application (PUA)
> A potentially unwanted program (PUP) or potentially unwanted application (PUA) is software that a user may perceive as unwanted or unnecessary.
> It is used as a subjective tagging criterion by security and parental control products.

Adware
> Adware, often called advertising-supported software by its developers, is software that generates revenue for its developer by automatically generating online advertisements in the user interface of the software or on a screen presented to the user during the installation process.
