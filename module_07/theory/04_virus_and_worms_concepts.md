# Section 04: Virus and Worms Concepts

## Viruses and Worms
Virus
> A computer virus is a type of computer program that, when executed, replicates itself by modifying other computer programs and inserting its own code.

Polymorphic virus
> A polymorphic virus is a harmful, destructive or intrusive type of malware that can change or "morph," making it difficult to detect with antimalware programs.

Metamorphic virus
> Metamorphic code is code that when run outputs a logically equivalent version of its own code under some interpretation. This is similar to a quine, except that a quine's source code is exactly equivalent to its own output. Metamorphic code also usually outputs machine code and not its own source code.

Macro virus
> In computing terminology, a macro virus is a virus that is written in a macro language: a programming language which is embedded inside a software application (e.g., word processors and spreadsheet applications).

Boot sector virus
> A boot sector virus is a type of malware that infects a system's boot partition or the Master Boot Record (MBR) of a hard disk.
> During startup and before security software can be executed, the virus executes malicious code.

Logic bomb
> A logic bomb is a piece of code intentionally inserted into a software system that will set off a malicious function when specified conditions are met.
> For example, a programmer may hide a piece of code that starts deleting files (such as a salary database trigger), should they ever be terminated from the company.

Virus hoax
> A computer virus hoax is a message warning the recipients of a non-existent computer virus threat.
> The message is usually a chain e-mail that tells the recipients to forward it to everyone they know, but it can also be in the form of a pop-up window.
 
Worm
> A computer worm is a standalone malware computer program that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers.
> It often uses a computer network to spread itself, relying on security failures on the target computer to access it.
