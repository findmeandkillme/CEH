# Section 02: NetBIOS Enumeration

## NetBIOS
NetBIOS
> NetBIOS (/ˈnɛtbaɪɒs/) is an acronym for Network Basic Input/Output System.
> It provides services related to the session layer of the OSI model allowing applications on separate computers to communicate over a local area network.
> As strictly an API, NetBIOS is not a networking protocol.

Nbtstat
> Nbstat is a utility that displays protocol statistics and current TCP/IP connections using NBT (NetBIOS over TCP/IP), which helps troubleshoot NetBIOS name resolution issues.

nmap
> Nmap is a network scanner created by Gordon Lyon.
> Nmap is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses.
> Nmap provides a number of features for probing computer networks, including host discovery and service and operating system detection.
