## Other Techniques
IPSec
> In computing, Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a secure network protocol suite that authenticates and encrypts packets of data to provide secure encrypted communication between two computers over an Internet Protocol network.
> It is used in virtual private networks (VPNs).

RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
> Microsoft RPC (Microsoft Remote Procedure Call) is a modified version of DCE/RPC.
> Additions include partial support for UCS-2 (but not Unicode) strings, implicit handles, and complex calculations in the variable-length string and structure paradigms already present in DCE/RPC.

Telnet
> Telnet is an application protocol used on the Internet or local area network to provide a bidirectional interactive text-oriented communication facility using a virtual terminal connection.

SMB (Server Message Block)
> Server Message Block (SMB) is a communication protocol originally developed in 1983 by Barry A.
> Feigenbaum at IBM and intended to provide shared access to files and printers across nodes on a network of systems running IBM's OS/2.
 
FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
> The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard communication protocol used for the transfer of computer files from a server to a client on a computer network.

BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)
> Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a standardized exterior gateway protocol designed to exchange routing and reachability information among autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet.
