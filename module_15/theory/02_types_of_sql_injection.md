# Section 02: Types of SQL Injection

## Types
Error based SQLi
> The attacker performs actions that cause the database to produce error messages.
> The attacker can potentially use the data provided by these error messages to gather information about the structure of the database.

Union based SQLi
> this technique takes advantage of the UNION SQL operator, which fuses multiple select statements generated by the database to get a single HTTP response.
> This response may contain data that can be leveraged by the attacker.

Boolean based SQLi
> that attacker sends a SQL query to the database prompting the application to return a result.
> The result will vary depending on whether the query is true or false.
> Based on the result, the information within the HTTP response will modify or stay unchanged.
> The attacker can then work out if the message generated a true or false result.

Time based SQLi
> attacker sends a SQL query to the database, which makes the database wait (for a period in seconds) before it can react.
> The attacker can see from the time the database takes to respond, whether a query is true or false.
> Based on the result, an HTTP response will be generated instantly or after a waiting period.
