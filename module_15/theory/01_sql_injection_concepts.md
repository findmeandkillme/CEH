# Section 01: SQL Injection Concepts

## Concepts
SQL (Structured query language)
> Structured Query Language, abbreviated as SQL,(/ˈsiːkwəl/ "sequel", /ˌɛsˌkjuːˈɛl/ (listen) S-Q-L; )[4][5] is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).

SQL (Structured query language) injection
> In computing, SQL injection is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution (e.g. to dump the database contents to the attacker).

RCE (Remote code execution)
> In computer security, arbitrary code execution (ACE) is an attacker's ability to run any commands or code of the attacker's choice on a target machine or in a target process.
> An arbitrary code execution vulnerability is a security flaw in software or hardware allowing arbitrary code execution.
