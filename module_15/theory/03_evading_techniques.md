# Section 03: Evading Techniques

## Evading Techniques
IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
> An intrusion detection system (IDS; also intrusion prevention system or IPS) is a device or software application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations.

Encoding
> Character encoding is the process of assigning numbers to graphical characters, especially the written characters of human language, allowing them to be stored, transmitted, and transformed using digital computers.

Obfuscation
> In software development, obfuscation is the act of creating source or machine code that is difficult for humans or computers to understand.
> Like obfuscation in natural language, it may use needlessly roundabout expressions to compose statements.

String concatenation
> In formal language theory and computer programming, string concatenation is the operation of joining character strings end-to-end.
> For example, the concatenation of "snow" and "ball" is "snowball".
> In certain formalisations of concatenation theory, also called string theory, string concatenation is a primitive notion.

Null byte
> The null character (also null terminator) is a control character with the value zero.
> It is present in many character sets, including those defined by the Baudot and ITA2 codes, ISO/IEC 646 (or ASCII), the C0 control code, the Universal Coded Character Set (or Unicode), and EBCDIC.
> It is available in nearly all mainstream programming languages. 
> A null character can be placed in a URL with the percent code %00.
