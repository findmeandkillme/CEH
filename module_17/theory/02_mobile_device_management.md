# Section 02: Mobile Device Management

## Mobile Device Management
MDM (Mobile device management)
> Mobile device management (MDM) is the administration of mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablet computers, and laptops.
> MDM is usually implemented with the use of a third-party product that has management features for particular vendors of mobile devices.

BYOD (Bring your own device)
> Bring your own device (BYOD /ˌbiː waɪ oʊ ˈdiː/)—also called bring your own technology (BYOT), bring your own phone (BYOP), and bring your own personal computer (BYOPC)—refers to being allowed to use one's personally owned device, rather than being required to use an officially provided device.

POCE (Personally owned, corporate enabled)
> A personally owned device is any technology device that was purchased by an individual and was not issued by the agency. A personal device includes any portable technology such as cameras, USB flash drives, mobile wireless devices, tablets, laptops or personal desktop computers.

COPE (Coorperate owned, personally enabled)
> As part of enterprise mobility, an alternative approach are corporate-owned, personally enabled devices (COPE). Under such policies, the company purchases and provides devices to their employees, but the functionality of a private device is enabled to allow personal usage.
