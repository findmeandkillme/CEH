# Section 05: ARP poisoning

## Spoofing
MAC spoofing
> MAC spoofing is a technique for changing a factory-assigned Media Access Control (MAC) address of a network interface on a networked device.
> The MAC address that is hard-coded on a network interface controller (NIC) cannot be changed.
> However, many drivers allow the MAC address to be changed.

VLAN hopping
> VLAN hopping is a computer security exploit, a method of attacking networked resources on a virtual LAN (VLAN).
> The basic concept behind all VLAN hopping attacks is for an attacking host on a VLAN to gain access to traffic on other VLANs that would normally not be accessible.

STP (Spanning tree protocol)
> The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a network protocol that builds a loop-free logical topology for Ethernet networks.
> The basic function of STP is to prevent bridge loops and the broadcast radiation that results from them.
