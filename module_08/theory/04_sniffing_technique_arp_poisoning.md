# Section 04: ARP poisoning

## ARP poisoning
ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
> The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a communication protocol used for discovering the link layer address, such as a MAC address, associated with a given internet layer address, typically an IPv4 address.
> This mapping is a critical function in the Internet protocol suite.
> ARP was defined in 1982 by RFC 826, which is Internet Standard STD 37.

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) spoofing
> In computer networking, ARP spoofing, ARP cache poisoning, or ARP poison routing, is a technique by which an attacker sends (spoofed) Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) messages onto a local area network.
