# Section 02: MAC Attacks

## MAC Attacks
MAC (Media Access Control) address
> A media access control address (MAC address) is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use as a network address in communications within a network segment.

A universally administered address is uniquely assigned to a device by its manufacturer. The first three octets (in transmission order) identify the organization that issued the identifier and are known as the organizationally unique identifier (OUI).[2] The remainder of the address (three octets for EUI-48 or five for EUI-64) are assigned by that organization in nearly any manner they please, subject to the constraint of uniqueness.

CAM (Content Addressable Memory) table
> Content Addressable Memory (CAM) table is a system memory construct used by Ethernet switch logic which stores information such as MAC addresses available on physical ports with their associated VLAN Parameters.

MAC (Media Access Controll) flooding
> In computer networking, a media access control attack or MAC flooding is a technique employed to compromise the security of network switches.
