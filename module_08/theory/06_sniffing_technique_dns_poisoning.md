# Section 06: DNS poisoning

## DNS poisoning
DNS (Domain name system)
> The Domain Name System (DNS) is the hierarchical and distributed naming system used to identify computers reachable through the Internet or other Internet Protocol (IP) networks.

DNS spoofing
> DNS spoofing, also referred to as DNS cache poisoning, is a form of computer security hacking in which corrupt Domain Name System data is introduced into the DNS resolver's cache, causing the name server to return an incorrect result record, e.g. an IP address.
> This results in traffic being diverted to the attacker's computer (or any other computer).
