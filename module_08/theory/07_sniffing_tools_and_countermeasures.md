# Section 07: Sniffing Tools and Countermeasures

## Sniffing Tools
Wireshark
> Wireshark is the world’s foremost and widely-used network protocol analyzer.
> It lets you see what’s happening on your network at a microscopic level and is the de facto (and often de jure) standard across many commercial and non-profit enterprises, government agencies, and educational institutions.
> Wireshark development thrives thanks to the volunteer contributions of networking experts around the globe and is the continuation of a project started by Gerald Combs in 1998.
