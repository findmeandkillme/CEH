# Section 01: Vulnerability Assessment Concepts

## Vulnerability
Vulnerability
> Vulnerabilities are flaws in a computer system that weaken the overall security of the device/system.
> Vulnerabilities can be weaknesses in either the hardware itself, or the software that runs on the hardware.

Examples
- Protocols such as HTTP, FTP, telnet are inherently insecure
- OS is not patched / using latest version
- Software / hardware using weak or default credentials
- Misconfigurations in different part of the stack

Microsoft Security Response Center
> The Microsoft Security Response Center is part of the defender community and on the front line of security response evolution.
> For over twenty years, we have been engaged with security researchers working to protect customers and the broader ecosystem.

Vulnerability Assessment
> A vulnerability assessment is a systematic review of security weaknesses in an information system.

## CVEs
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
> The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system provides a reference-method for publicly known information-security vulnerabilities and exposures.

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
> The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a free and open industry standard for assessing the severity of computer system security vulnerabilities.

National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
> The NVD is the U.S. government repository of standards based vulnerability management data represented using the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP).
> This data enables automation of vulnerability management, security measurement, and compliance.
> The NVD includes databases of security checklist references, security-related software flaws, misconfigurations, product names, and impact metrics.

Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)
> The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for hardware and software weaknesses and vulnerabilities.
